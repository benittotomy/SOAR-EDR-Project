##SOAR EDR Project

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) are critical components in modern cybersecurity operations. SOAR platforms enable security teams to manage, automate, and streamline security operations, allowing for faster and more effective responses to threats. EDR solutions provide continuous monitoring and response capabilities for endpoint devices, detecting and mitigating cyber threats.

The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with SOAR and EDR technologies by using LimaCharlie for endpoint detection and Tines for automating response workflows. Throughout this project, we will develop and implement detection and response rules, automate alert handling, and create playbooks to enhance the efficiency of security operations.

##Tools Used

* LimaCharlie: An EDR platform used for monitoring and threat detection on endpoints.
* Tines: A SOAR platform for automating incident response tasks.
* Draw.io: A diagramming tool used to design the playbook workflow.
* Slack: A communication platform for sending real-time alerts.
* Email: Used for sending detailed alert notifications.
